dotfiles
========

My collection of dotfiles, for [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and
[emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs), primarily. I've been
toting these around from one system to another since 1992.

[Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) is a pretty
good way to keep your dotfiles in sync via github and symlinks.
